Week 1:
For each multiple of n in the given array, change all the values following it to be that multiple of n, until encountering another multiple of n.

Example:
multiple(10, [2, 10, 3, 4, 20, 5]) → [2, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20]
multiple(5, [10, 1, 20, 2]) → [10, 10, 20, 20]
multiple(3, [10, 1, 9, 20]) → [10, 1, 9, 9]
